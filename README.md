# Stack-uses-and-palindromes
Tests strings for palindrome using a Stack class
All spaces were ignored for testing for the palindrome.
Palindromes can be done a lot simpler without using a Stack class.

A class Stackcommands lets the user create and command their own stack of type char. This is restricted to char as the Stack(). To change data type, read comments in stack.java
